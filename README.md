The scope of this project is to interactive visualise the development of world food price in countries over the past ten years. The data set collects information on the development of food prices in developing countries. It contains around 700,000 data points with detailed facts about the country, price, time, city, market and sales channel. The following graphics show the most important information about this data set.

The User has the ability to have different views on the data and by that he can figure out relavent information for him. As he has a deeper overview of the data, we provide a form to forecast price development for the future.
